## Overview
This repository was created as part of a learning exercise to practice fundamental programming concepts. Each exercise is implemented in both JavaScript and TypeScript to demonstrate the differences and benefits of using typed programming languages.

## Features
- **Temperature Conversion**: Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- **Unit Conversion**: Convert between centimeters and kilometers.
- **Number Checking**: Determine if a number is even or odd.
- **String Manipulation**: Remove the first occurrence of a substring.
- **Palindrome Detection**: Check if a string is a palindrome.
